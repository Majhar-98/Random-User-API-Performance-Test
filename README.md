# Random-User-API-Performance-Test
## Purpose of Performance Testing:
Features and Functionality supported by a software system are not the only concern. A software applicationâ€™s performance, like its response time, reliability, resource usage, and scalability, do matter. The goal of Performance Testing is not to find bugs but to eliminate performance bottlenecks.




## Why Choose Apache JMeter for API Testing?

1. Open-source tool - The Apache JMeter is an open-source tool based on Java used to perform load testing and performance testing.
2. Cross-platform testing - Since JMeter is solely Java-based, it can be used on any platform that has a JVM; Windows, Linux, or macOS.
3. Smooth API Testing - API Testing enables easy, smooth, and rapid API testing.

## Load Testing Strategy:
In Load testing, I got always actual tps when I hit the .https://random-data-api.com/api/v2/users server with multiple users in severl times in every request. The actual value is 2.7 which is close to expected value. I did nit found any error when I hit the system.

## Stress Testing Strategy:
When, I hit the system with 4200 users in 1200 second then, I find out the bottleneck/stress test point which is exactly 1% error.
